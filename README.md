# Magic::Link
Short description and motivation.

## Usage
configure the gem
```ruby
# config/initializers/magic_link.rb
Magic::Link.configure do |config|
  config.user_class = "Customer" # Default is User
  config.email_from = "test@yourapp.com"
  config.token_expiration_hours = 6 # Default is 6
  config.force_new_tokens = false # Default is false
end
```

Add `sign_in_token` and `sign_in_token_sent_at` to your Devise class

mount the engine
```ruby
mount Magic::Link::Engine, at: '/'
```

Now users can visit `/magic_links/new` (which you can link to with `magic_link.new_magic_link_path`) to enter their email and have a sign in
link sent to them via email. Tokens are cleared after use and expire after the
configured number of hours

```ruby
